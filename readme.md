## LANL Earthquake Prediction Model

This model was built for the [LANL Earthquake Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/c/LANL-Earthquake-Prediction) challenge hosted by Kaggle.

The problem is to predict the timing of the next quake based on (seismic) signal measurements.

The model is fairly simple:
 - Downsample the signal at a rate of 4:1
 - Generate spectrograms of the input signal segments
 - Produce aggregations from the spectrogram: mean, min, max, and quantiles; for the entire signal as well as aggregations at each frequency band.
 - Train a gradient boosted model (XGBoost) with a regression task.  Although Mean Absolute Error (MAE) was the metric used to evaluate submissions, RMSE was used as the loss function and helped to reduce underfitting near the boundaries of the data.

The predictions generated by this model ranked 21st of over 4500 submissions.  Several more elaborate approaches were tested, including feedforward networks, 1- and 2-dimensional [convolutional neural nets (CNN)](https://www.kaggle.com/michael422/spectrogram-convolution), and [Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)](https://www.kaggle.com/michael422/tf-lstm-on-acoustic-signals) models.  XGBoost yielded the best results, and outperformed LightGBM for this task.

The scripts in this repo require numpy, pandas, XGBoost, and the [mltools](https://github.com/epsdg/mltools) library.
